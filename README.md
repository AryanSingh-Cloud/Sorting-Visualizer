# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Java Swing) 🎮🔍 
<br></br>
*Visualize sorting algorithms with Java Swing and DSA concepts.*
<br>
📌 Description  
  "A desktop application built with Java Swing to visualize sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.). Adjust array size, speed, and data distribution to 
   see how algorithms work step-by-step."
   <br>
✨ Features 
- Interactive GUI with controls for array size, speed, and randomization.  
- Real-time visualization of swaps, comparisons, and pivot elements.  
- Support for multiple algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.).  
- Threading to prevent GUI freezing during sorting.
